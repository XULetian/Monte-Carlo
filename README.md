# Monte-Carlo
I had taken the CDM course CSC 521 Monte Carlo Algorithim in 2017-2018 winter quarter, and here is the final project finished with Python.

Professor's requirement posted below.

# Problem 3 (the fun problem)

Do you know the video game “snake”? 
Implement a simulator for the game. The snake is a one dimensional object of length 30cm. It moves at a speed of 1cm/second. It lives in a cage of 1000cm x 1000cm. The snake can only move horizontally or vertically. At random intervals (1 every 5 seconds in average) the snake can turn left or right. If the snake intersect itself, the snake bites itself and dies. The snake starts moving at the center of the cage. 

I bet $1000 that the snake will bite itself before it reaches the end of the cage. Is this a good bet? Explain. (optional: can you visualize it with tkinter)

Write a short paper (10 pages), explaining the problem, your solution, answers to the above questions with explanations, and an appendix containing the code (commented and indented).
