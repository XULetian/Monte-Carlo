    "----\n",
    "Do you know the video game “snake”? Implement a simulator for the game. The snake is a one dimensional object of length 30cm. It moves at a speed of 1cm/second. It lives in a cage of 1000cm x 1000cm. The snake can only move horitontally or vertically. At random intervals (1 every 5 seconds in average) the snake can turn left or right. If the snake intersect itself, the snake bites itself and dies. The snake starts moving at the center of the cage. I bet $1000 that the snake will bite itself before it reaches the end of the cage. Is this a good bet? Explain. (optional: can you visualize it with tkinter)\n",

    "Basically, this problem is trying to figure out what is the chance that this snake can reach the edge of cage without bites itself. Based on the bet, we know that higher the chance, worse the bet.\n",

If we imagine how the snake escape, for total distance is 500, and average gap is 5, the snake needs to make average 100 times changing direction, and every two same turning direction will make it harder to reach the edge. The most ideal way for the snake reach the edge is that the snake will make every changing direction are different with its last changing direction.
